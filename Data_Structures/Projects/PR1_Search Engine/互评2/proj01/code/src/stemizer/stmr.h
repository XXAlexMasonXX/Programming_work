/* In `stem(p, i, j)`, `p` is a `char` pointer, and the
 * string to be stemmed is from `p[i]` to
 * `p[j]` (inclusive).
 *
 * Typically, `i` is zero and `j` is the offset to the
 * last character of a string, `(p[j + 1] == '\0')`.
 * The stemmer adjusts the characters `p[i]` ... `p[j]`
 * and returns the new end-point of the string, `k`.
 *
 * Stemming never increases word length, so `i <= k <= j`.
 *
 * To turn the stemmer into a module, declare 'stem' as
 * extern, and delete the remainder of this file. */
